This repo is public. All students have access to this.

## Student Instructions:
### Looking for a few specifics (i.e. one or a few scripts, comments, method signatures, etc.)?
Navigate through this repo to find what you're looking for.
You may browse through the repo here in GitHub to see all scripts that I have written.  

### Need to see the Unity project?
Students can *always* download the entire project as a .zip file.
Unzip the file and open your desired scene in Unity to see exactly what I demonstrated in class.
This option is helpful if you need to see GameObjects, hierarchical GameObjects, Inspector-set values, components, etc.
